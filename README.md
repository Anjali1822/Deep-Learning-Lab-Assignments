# Deep Learning Assignments

This repository contains the implementation of various deep learning assignments as part of the final year curriculum for Information Technology (2019 Course) at Savitribai Phule Pune University.

## Assignment 1: Study of Deep Learning Packages

### Overview
In this assignment, we explore and document the distinct features and functionality of popular deep learning packages, including TensorFlow, Keras, Theano, and PyTorch.

## Assignment 2: Implementing Feedforward Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow

### Overview
Build and train a feedforward neural network using Keras and TensorFlow.

### Steps
a. Import the necessary packages
b. Load the training and testing data (MNIST/CIFAR10)
c. Define the network architecture using Keras
d. Train the model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
e. Evaluate the network
f. Plot the training loss and accuracy

## Assignment 3: Image Classification Model

### Overview
Build an image classification model in four stages.

### Stages
a. Loading and preprocessing the image data
b. Defining the model’s architecture
c. Training the model
d. Estimating the model’s performance

## Assignment 4: Anomaly Detection with Autoencoder

### Overview
Implement anomaly detection using autoencoders.

### Steps
a. Import required libraries
b. Upload/access the dataset
c. Encoder converts data into latent representation
d. Decoder networks convert it back to the original input
e. Compile the models with Optimizer, Loss, and Evaluation Metrics

## Assignment 5: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model

### Overview
Implement the Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model.

### Stages
a. Data preparation
b. Generate training data
c. Train model
d. Output

## Assignment 6: Object Detection using Transfer Learning

### Overview
Object detection using transfer learning of CNN architectures.

### Steps
a. Load a pre-trained CNN model trained on a large dataset
b. Freeze parameters (weights) in the model’s lower convolutional layers
c. Add a custom classifier with several layers of trainable parameters to the model
d. Train classifier layers on available training data
e. Fine-tune hyperparameters and unfreeze more layers as needed

## Dataset
Ensure to use a suitable dataset for the implementation of the assignments.
